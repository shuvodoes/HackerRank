## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to my repository of HackerRank solutions! This repo serves as a log of my practice with algorithms, data structures, and mathematics. The goal is not just to solve the problem, but to find the most efficient (Time & Space Complexity) solution.

## 🛠️ Languages Used
* **Python** (Primary)
* **C++** (For performance-critical algorithms)
* **SQL** (Database challenges)

## 📂 Repository Structure
The solutions are organized by domain to keep things tidy
